in this project we preparing a custom dataset to train and detect it in real time.

#### in this project we use yolov5:

## How you should use the src:
1- at first download the dataset from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qY25-g_HVWJDs7Lzq5mxdDg50-wbF0Up?usp=sharing

2- then go to https://roboflow.com/ and create a free account
- create a workspace 
- select object detection project
- labeling your images
- set your custom dataset setting 
- after complite all steps in roboflow it will give you two options:
    - download the zip file or get the download python code and we need the secend one
        - replace that code on the src and set the paths
- follow the src steps.

in this project we pretrained model so its not complicated you can do it in 30 min.

good luck.
